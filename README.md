How far will i get in parsing vcards before I give up and do the
work that I actually need to get done for tomorrow?

Pretty far! Well, I got what I needed, anyway.

This code "parses" (and I use that word in a preposterously generous
way) .vcf files as generated by Apple Contacts as of 2023-01-22
on this particular machine. It generates a hash for each card,
mapping what appears to be a field name to all of the corresponding
values.

How to Use:

* Extract a christmas.vcf card
* Run main.rkt, correct any problems by adding entries to name-hints-private and address-hints-private
* On success, christmas.csv is generated
